tribal populations india older populations autosomal differentiation genetic diversity within india caste populations significantly lower continental populations 31 world population sets studied watkins et suggesting tribal populations differentiated differentiation effects within india caste population less previously thought majumder also concludes recent studies suggest india major contributor gene pool southeast asia another study covering large sample indian populations allowed watkins et al examine eight indian caste groups four endogamous south indian tribal populations indian castes data show low differences tribal indian groups show relatively high differentiation suggests people indian castes reproductively isolated indian tribal populations experienced reproductive isolation drift furthermore genetic fixation index data show historical genetic differentiation segregation indian castes population much smaller found east asia africa continental
