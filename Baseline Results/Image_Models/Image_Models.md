## Image Similarity Models

To effectively process image data, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were employed in our methodology. CNNs are
pivotal in extracting intricate features from images, enabling
the recommendation of relevant images based on input data.
Our approach encompasses two distinct implementations:
one leveraging AutoEncoders for feature space reduction,
and the other entails the utilization of pre-trained models
encompassing contemporary CNN architectures like ResNet,
VGG, and Inception.
In our study, CNNs serve as the cornerstone of image
analysis and recommendation systems due to their capability to discern complex patterns within image data. This
approach not only enables the extraction of relevant features
from input images but also ensures compatibility with di-
verse image datasets, which is very important for the type of
data that we are dealing with in this project
Training our models in an unsupervised manner was a
deliberate choice, enabling them to autonomously learn from
the inherent structures and distributions present in the data.
By forgoing explicit labels, our models could extract meaningful features and patterns without the need for human
annotation. This approach not only streamlines the training
process but also enhances the adaptability of our models to
new datasets and scenarios, ensuring their robustness and
versatility in real-world applications
