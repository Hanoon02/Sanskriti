version python albeit support phase due python reaching design philosophy features python programming language programming structured programming fully supported many features support functional programming programming including metaprogramming metaobjects many paradigms supported via extensions including design contract logic uses dynamic typing combination reference counting garbage collector memory management uses dynamic name resolution late binding binds method variable names program execution design offers support functional programming lisp tradition filter mapandreduce functions list comprehensions dictionaries sets generator expressions standard library two modules itertools functools implement functional tools borrowed haskell standard core philosophy summarized zen python pep 20 includes aphorisms beautiful better ugly explicit better implicit simple better complex complex better complicated readability building functionality core python designed highly extensible via modules compact modularity made particularly popular means adding programmable interfaces existing applications van rossum vision small core language large standard library easily extensible interpreter stemmed frustrations abc espoused opposite strives simpler syntax grammar giving developers choice coding methodology contrast perl one way motto python embraces one—and preferably one—obvious way philosophy alex martelli fellow python software foundation python book author wrote describe something considered compliment python culture one benefit approach greater consistency across python user communities shared understanding coding principles python developers usually strive avoid premature optimization reject patches parts cpython reference implementation would offer marginal increases speed cost clarity execution speed improved moving functions extension modules written languages c using compiler like pypy also possible languages either provide full might expected since python dynamic language restricted subset python compiled possibly semantics slightly developers aim fun use reflected name—a tribute british comedy group monty python—and occasionally playful approaches tutorials reference materials use terms spam eggs reference monty python sketch examples instead foo bar common neologism python community pythonic wide range meanings related program style pythonic code may use python idioms well natural show fluency language conform python minimalist philosophy emphasis readability code difficult understand reads like rough transcription another programming language called unpythonic syntax semantics python meant easily readable language formatting visually uncluttered often uses english keywords languages use punctuation unlike many languages use curly brackets delimit blocks semicolons statements allowed rarely used fewer syntactic exceptions special cases c pascal indentation python uses whitespace indentation rather curly brackets keywords delimit blocks increase indentation comes certain statements decrease indentation signifies end current block thus program visual structure accurately represents semantic structure feature sometimes termed rule languages use indentation way indentation semantic meaning recommended indent size four spaces statements control flow python statements include assignment statement using single equals sign statement conditionally executes block code along else elif contraction statement iterates iterable object capturing element local variable use attached block statement executes block code long condition true try statement allows exceptions raised attached code block caught handled except clauses new syntax except python exception groups also ensures code finally block always run regardless block exits raise statement used raise specified exception caught exception class statement executes block code attaches local namespace class use programming def statement defines function method statement encloses code block within context manager example acquiring lock run releasing lock opening closing file allowing raii behavior replacing common idiom break statement exits loop continue statement skips rest current iteration continues next del statement removes variable—deleting reference name value producing error variable referred redefined pass statement serving nop syntactically needed create empty code block assert statement used debugging check conditions apply yield statement returns value generator function also operator used implement coroutines return statement used return value function import statements used import modules whose functions variables used current programthe assignment statement binds name reference separate dynamically allocated object variables may subsequently rebound time object python variable name generic reference holder without fixed data type however always refers object type called dynamic typing—in contrast languages variable may contain value certain type python support tail call optimization continuations according van rossum never however better support functionality provided extending python generators generators lazy iterators data passed unidirectionally generator python possible pass data back generator function version passed multiple stack levels expressions python expressions include operators mathematical addition subtraction multiplication similar languages behavior division differs two types divisions python floor division integer division python uses operator exponentiation python uses operator string concatenation python uses operator duplicating string specified number times infix operator intended used libraries numpy matrix multiplication syntax called walrus operator introduced python assigns values variables part larger expression python compares value python operator may used compare object identities comparison reference comparisons may chained—for example b python uses boolean operators python type expression called list comprehension well general expression called generator expression anonymous functions implemented using lambda expressions however may one expression body conditional expressions written x c else different order operands c x operator common many languages python makes distinction lists tuples lists written 1 2 3 mutable used keys dictionaries dictionary keys must immutable python tuples written 1 2 3 immutable thus used keys dictionaries provided tuple elements immutable operator used concatenate two tuples directly modify contents produces new tuple containing elements thus given variable initially equal 1 2 3 executing 4 5 first evaluates 4 5 yields 1 2 3 4 5 assigned back t—thereby effectively modifying contents conforming immutable nature tuple objects parentheses optional tuples unambiguous contexts python features sequence unpacking multiple expressions evaluating anything assigned variable writable property etc associated identical manner forming tuple literals—and whole put side equal sign assignment statement statement expects iterable object side equal sign produces number values provided writable expressions iterated assigns produced values corresponding expression left python string format operator functions analogously printf format strings blah 2 evaluates python supplemented format method str class 0 1 blah 2 python added spam blah eggs 2 spam eggs strings python concatenated adding operator adding integers floats spam eggs returns spameggs strings contain numbers added strings rather integers 2 2 returns 22 python various string literals delimited single double quotes unlike unix shells perl languages single double quotes work use backslash escape character string interpolation became available python formatted string literals beginning ending three single double quotes may span multiple lines function like documents shells perl ruby raw string varieties denoted prefixing string literal escape sequences interpreted hence raw strings useful literal backslashes common regular expressions paths compare c python array index array slicing expressions lists denoted key start stop start stop step indexes negative indexes relative end slices take elements start index including stop index third slice parameter called step stride allows elements skipped reversed slice indexes may omitted—for example returns copy entire list element slice shallow python distinction expressions statements rigidly enforced contrast languages common lisp scheme ruby leads duplicating functionality example list comprehensions conditional expressions blocks eval exec functions python 2 exec statement former expressions latter statementsstatements part expression—so list comprehensions lambda expressions expressions contain statements particular case assignment statement 1 form part conditional expression conditional statement advantage avoiding classic c error mistaking assignment operator equality operator conditions c 1 syntactically valid probably unintended c code c 1 causes syntax error python methods methods objects functions attached object class syntax argument normal methods functions syntactic sugar instance argument python methods explicit self parameter access instance data contrast implicit self programming languages java ruby python also provides methods often called dunder methods due names beginning ending allow classes modify handled native operations including length comparison arithmetic operations type conversion typing python uses duck typing typed objects untyped variable names type constraints checked compile time rather operations object may fail signifying suitable type despite dynamically typed python strongly typed forbidding operations example adding number string rather silently attempting make sense python allows programmers define types using classes often used programming new instances classes constructed calling class example spamclass eggsclass classes instances metaclass type instance allowing metaprogramming reflection version python two kinds classes using syntax current python versions support semantics new style python supports optional type annotations annotations enforced language may used external tools mypy catch errors mypy also supports python compiler called mypyc leverages type annotations optimization arithmetic operations python usual symbols arithmetic operators floor division operator modulo operation remainder negative 4 also exponentiation 5 3 125 9 matrix‑multiplication operator operators work like traditional math precedence rules operators infix also unary represent positive negative numbers respectively division integers produces results behavior division changed significantly time current python since changed always division floor division operator introduced 2 adding import division causes module used python use python rules division see python terms true division simply division floor division version classic towards negative infinity though different languages adds consistency instance means equation b 1 always true also means equation b b valid positive negative values however maintaining validity equation means result b expected interval 0 b b positive integer lie interval b 0 b provides round function rounding float nearest integer python 3 uses round even round round produce versions 3 used round round allows boolean expressions multiple equality relations manner consistent general use mathematics example expression b c tests whether less b b less languages interpret expression differently c expression would first evaluate b resulting 0 1 result would
